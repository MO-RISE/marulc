# jasmine

A parser for NMEA 0183 and 2000 messages

## Example usage

See tests for now


## ToDo:

- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Helper function for streaming input (basically support any kind of stream that yields strings with NMEA messages)
- [ ] Helper functions for extracting timeseries. (I.e converting from array of structs to structs of arrays)
